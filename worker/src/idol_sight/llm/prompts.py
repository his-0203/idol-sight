- top_news_by_group (recent press headlines)

Produce 3-7 distinct items that a strategy team would act on. For each item:
- `scope`: either 'market' (cross-group) or a specific group_key
  (plave/isedol/stellive/skinz/myrakl/owis/miiwan/bdawn).
- `type`: 'insight' (analytic observation), 'weekly' (week summary),
  or 'ipx_action' (recommended action for the team).
- `title`: ≤ 80 chars, Korean.
- `body`: 1-3 sentences, Korean. Reference numbers from the context.
- `source_refs`: 1-3 items pointing at the rows that justified the claim.
  Each ref has table, pk (key|date format), and label.

Be precise with numbers (use exactly what the context shows).
Do NOT invent figures. If something cannot be sourced, leave it out.
